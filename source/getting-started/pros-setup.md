# PROS 3 Setup

## Initial PROS for V5 Setup

- We will be using the Visual Studio Code PROS Extension for Robot Software development. Note that we will be using PROS 3, which is the kernel that runs on the VEX V5 microcontroller platform. 
- Install the latest version of the Pros Command Line Interface suited for your machine (link). When installing, customize the installation with the following criteria:
   1. Pros Installation Type: It is only necessary to have PROS installed for one user, so chose `Only for me (Username)`
   2. Features (~~strikethrough~~ means I did not include): 
      - PROS Editor 
      - Toolchain on PATH
      - Old Programming Cable Driver
      - Programming Cable Driver
      - V5 Drivers
      - V5 Vision Sensor Utility
