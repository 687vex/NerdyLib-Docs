# Git/GitHub Setup

## Understanding Version Control, Git, & GitHub

- If Version Control is a concept, then Git and GitHub are the real-life tools used to implement that concept. Git is the powerful, behind-the-scenes software that makes version control possible. GitHub is a user-friendly interface and code repository that is built on Git's software.
  - To learn more about the high-level concepts of Git and GitHub, read through the [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/) and [Introduction to Git](https://www.notion.so/zarkom/Introduction-to-Git-ac396a0697704709a12b6a0e545db049#d5e9c2b6379246a593c1ef74051e7e3c).
- Git is not the only version control software available, but it is one of the most popular. For the curious, other version control software includes:
  - [Apache Subversion (SVN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion)
  - [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial)
  - [and many more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version-control_software)

## GitHub Setup

- We will be using Git for Version Control. Our robot’s software will be hosted as a Git Repository on the Git hosting platform [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- Read through [Introduction to GitHub](https://www.notion.so/zarkom/Introduction-to-GitHub-202af6f64bbd4299b15f238dcd09d2a7) which will help you create a GitHub account.
- To use GitHub a GitHub account is required and to work on a team's robot code repository permission to make changes to the repos.
  1. Create a GitHub account on the [GitHub website](https://github.com/).
  2. Talk to your team’s Programming Lead to be added to the [VEX 687 GitHub organization](https://github.com/687vex/). The software of every team’s robot code can be found in the organization.
- Install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) suited for your machine. If the installation was successful, running ``git --version`` on the command line should produce a similar output as below.
  ```{code-block} git
  git version 2.7.4
  ```

- Install the latest version of [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) best suited for your machine.
